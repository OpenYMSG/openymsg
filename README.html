<h2>The history of OpenYMSG</h2>
<p>OpenYMSG is based on jYMSG (<a
	href="http://jymsg9.sourceforge.net/">http://jymsg9.sourceforge.net</a>).
The initial development goal was to improve that library. During
discussions on how to achive this, different project goals surfaced.
This resulted in a mutual agreement to branch from the jYMSG development
tree, and start a new project. OpenYMSG was born.</p>
<p>To represent the branch and to acknowledge the original author(s)
for his work, <code>@author</code> javadoc tags have been included in
the orignal source files, and direct derivations thereof. As, at the
time of the branch, S.E. Morris was the project lead of jYMSG, this name
has been included in these tags. Where documented, other authors have
been included as well, but for a complete list of original authors,
please review the jYMSG home page.</p>

<h2>Building instructions</h2>
<p>The recommended way to build the OpenYMSG library is by using <a
	href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>. An Ant build script has
been included in the root directory of the project.</p>
<p>The default target of the Ant script, which you would run by
executing <code>ant</code> from a command line interface in the root
directory of this project, builds the complete library. Other targets
are available. A list of them can be retrieved by issuing <code>ant
-projecthelp</code>, again in the parent directory of this project.</p>
</div>

<div id="testing"><a name="testing"></a>
<h2>A note on testing</h2>
<p>Several <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> testcases have
been included in the project. Some of the included tests need to logon
to the Yahoo network to verify the correctness of this library.</p>
<p>The Yahoo Network is known to be very unforgiving for automated
logins. To circumvent potential problems, several different Yahoo
accounts should be used to execute the testcases.</p>
<p>Yahoo testaccounts can be configured by modifying the <code>yahooAuthenticationForJUnitTests.properties</code>
file in the <code>resources</code> directory. In it, several accounts
can be configured that will be used to run the junit test. Please refer
to that file for further information.</p>
