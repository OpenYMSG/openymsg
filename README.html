<h2>The history of OpenYMSG</h2>
<p>OpenYMSG is based on jYMSG (<a
	href="http://jymsg9.sourceforge.net/">http://jymsg9.sourceforge.net</a>).
The initial development goal was to improve that library. During
discussions on how to achive this, different project goals surfaced.
This resulted in a mutual agreement to branch from the jYMSG development
tree, and start a new project. OpenYMSG was born.</p>
<p>To represent the branch and to acknowledge the original author(s)
for his work, <code>@author</code> javadoc tags have been included in
the orignal source files, and direct derivations thereof. As, at the
time of the branch, S.E. Morris was the project lead of jYMSG, this name
has been included in these tags. Where documented, other authors have
been included as well, but for a complete list of original authors,
please review the jYMSG home page.</p>

<div id="building">
<h2>Building instructions</h2>
<p>The OpenYMSG library project is managed by<a
	href="http://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven 2</a>. A Maven POM has
been included that should be used to build the library.</p>
<p>The default way to build a package of the project is by executing
<tt>mvn&nbsp;clean&nbsp;package</tt> which you would run from a command
line interface in the root directory of this project.</p>
<p>By default, Maven runs all unit test. As the unit tests included
in OpenYMSG depend on responses from the Yahoo network, some of them can
fail, which will cause the package process to halt. You can skip the
tests by adding an extra argument to the Maven executable like this: <tt>mvn&nbsp;-Dmaven.test.skip&nbsp;clean&nbsp;package</tt>
</p>
<p>The default jar will not include the dependencies of the project.
If you'd like those included in a jar file, execute Maven like this
instead: <tt>mvn&nbsp;clean&nbsp;assembly:assembly</tt> (the optional <tt>-Dmaven.test.skip</tt>
flag can be used here as well, of course).</p>
<p>For more information on Maven usage, please refer to <a
	href="http://maven.apache.org/">http://maven.apache.org/</a></p>

<div id="testing">
<h2>A note on testing</h2>
<p>Several <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> testcases have
been included in the project. Some of the included tests need to logon
to the Yahoo network to verify the correctness of this library.</p>
<p>The Yahoo Network is known to be very unforgiving for automated
logins. To circumvent potential problems, several different Yahoo
accounts should be used to execute the testcases.</p>
<p>Yahoo testaccounts can be configured by modifying the <code>yahooAuthenticationForJUnitTests.properties</code>
file in the <code>resources</code> directory. In it, several accounts
can be configured that will be used to run the junit test. Please refer
to that file for further information.</p>
