<BODY>
	This library is a replacement for Yahoo Instant Messenger version
	9.0.0.2162.
	<H1>Overview</H1>
	<h2>Reasons for rewrite</h2>
	Single Threaded. Before there were 2 threads. Thread-safe. All changes
	are on the single thread. Interfaces to protect internals. Easier to
	provide multiple implementation. Easier for testing. More modular.
	Easier to make changes. Easier to test. Better tolerance for login
	failures. Consistent use of version 9 protocol.

	<h2>Current Limitations</h2>
	Multiple Identities are not supported. Connecting via HTTP is not
	supported.

	<H2>Version of Yahoo Instant Messenger</H2>
	Make sure that the protocol that is used is from version 9.0.0.2162.
	Many versions of Yahoo have a slightly different protocol. There may be
	issues with using some old and some new protocols. This project should
	be designed to support multiple protocols, but that is not yet done.
